## Adding new features

* This is how we like people to add new features: By making a PR to the `dev` branch        
* Here are some specifics on the coding style we prefer: properly formatted dart code using bloc state management
* This is how you send your pull request: Make PRs to `dev` and pls use meaningful commit messages              
* You should include the following tests: Just unit tests for now             
* These are the updates we hope you make to the changelog: N/A cause we haven't made a changelog yet

Don’t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is around ~1ish days

# Beta testing

We REALLY want more beta testers. If you're interested in beta testing the app, join the discord or reach out to one of the core members and we can get you set up :)

* For our project you can find the roadmap and features that require
testing from [here](https://github.com/InTheLoopStudio/pangolin/projects/1)

# Translations

If you'd like to help us translate Tapped and make it more accessible (this includes code OR documentation), reach out to one of the core members.

* You can help us translate our project [here](https://github.com/InTheLoopStudio/pangolin/wiki)

# Documentation

This section includes any help you need with the documentation and where it can be found. Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have trouble explaining it to someone just getting into it. 

* Help us with documentation here
